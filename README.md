## Introduction

Giselle is an open source AI for agentic workflows, enabling seamless human-AI collaboration.

## Using Giselle

### Cloud

We host [Giselle](https://giselles.ai/) as a cloud service for anyone to use instantly. It has all the same features as the self-hosted version, and includes 30 minutes of free Agent time per month in the free plan.

### Self-hosting

Follow this [starter guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#development-environment-setup) to get Giselle running in your environment.

### Vibe Coding Guide

If you're using AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, or WindSurf to help build with Giselle, check out our [Vibe Coding Guide](/docs/vibe/01-introduction.md). This guide explains:

- What is vibe coding and how to approach it effectively
- How to set up your Node.js environment and install dependencies
- Understanding Giselle's project structure
- Running the playground and connecting to LLM providers

Designed for both developers and non-engineers, this guide will help you harness the power of AI to build with Giselle without needing traditional coding expertise.

## Roadmap

Giselle is currently still in active development. The roadmap for the public repository is currently being created, and once it's finalized, we will update this README accordingly.
